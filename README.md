## üöÄ Product Vision

This project transforms passive YouTube videos into interactive learning experiences for children under 7 years old. I conceptualized and led the development of this product to explore how generative AI can create personalized educational experiences without requiring original content creation.

**Product Hypothesis:** By leveraging AI to analyze educational videos and generate interactive questions at natural break points, we can significantly improve knowledge retention and engagement for young learners compared to passive video consumption.

## üí° Why Build This

As a product leader exploring AI applications, I identified several key opportunities:

1. **Market Gap**: Existing edtech products require extensive original content creation, limiting scalability
2. **AI Potential**: New LLMs can understand video content and generate age-appropriate questions
3. **Digital Transformation**: Parents seek ways to transform passive screen time into active learning
4. **Technical Experimentation**: Practical application of multimodal AI models in a real product
5. **Hackathon Challenge**: The Google x MIT Hackathon provided the perfect opportunity to prototype this idea with a small, focused team
